This code was written while reading the book `Refactoring` by `Martin Fowler`. 
In the original book, the examples are given in `JavaScript` language, here I am trying to rewrite them in one of my favorite language.
The refactoring is my effort to learn the idea, not necessarily to follow the exact refactoring from the book.
Below are some tips from the book itself.

# Chapter 1. The First Step In Refactoring
- When you have to add a feature to a program, but the code is not structured in a convenient way,
first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature
- Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking
- Refactoring changes the program in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it is easy to find where th bug is
- Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand
- When programming, follow the comping rule: Always leave the code base healthier than when found it.
- The true test of good code is how easy it is to change it.
